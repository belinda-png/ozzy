  file.write("Agile Manifesto
The Agile Manifesto is a set of guiding values and principles for Agile software development. It was created in 2001 by a group of software developers who wanted a better approach to software development than the rigid, document-heavy methods used at the time.

Structure of the Agile Manifesto
It consists of:

Four core values:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan
Twelve principles, which emphasize continuous delivery, customer satisfaction, adaptability, face-to-face communication, self-organizing teams, and sustainable development.

An Agile Manifesto should be concise, values-driven, and principle-based to guide how teams work in a flexible and efficient manner.

Scrum Framework
Scrum is a lightweight, iterative, and flexible Agile framework designed to help teams deliver value incrementally and adapt quickly to changes. It is built on three key pillars:

Transparency – Work and progress should be visible to everyone.
Inspection – Frequent assessment of progress to detect any deviations.
Adaptation – Adjustments made based on feedback and learning.
Scrum Team Roles:
Product Owner – Defines priorities and ensures the team delivers maximum value.
Scrum Master – Facilitates the Scrum process, removes blockers, and coaches the team.
Development Team – Cross-functional group that builds the product.
Scrum Artifacts:
Product Backlog – A prioritized list of work (features, bugs, enhancements).
Sprint Backlog – A subset of backlog items selected for the sprint.
Increment – The completed and potentially shippable product at the end of a sprint.
Applying Scrum Activities
Sprint Planning – The team selects work from the backlog for a sprint (typically 2-4 weeks).
Daily Scrum (Stand-up Meeting) – A 15-minute meeting to sync up, identify roadblocks, and plan the day.
Sprint Execution – The team works on tasks in the Sprint Backlog.
Sprint Review – The team presents the work done to stakeholders for feedback.
Sprint Retrospective – The team reflects on the sprint, discussing improvements for the next cycle.
By following these steps, Scrum ensures continuous improvement, faster delivery, and higher adaptability to customer needs.
